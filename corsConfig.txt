This is text to remind how CORS work

const allowedOrigins = [
    'http://127.0.0.1:5500',
    'http://example.com.br'
    // remind to to a hard refresh on browser to verify! (shift + refresh)
]

app.use(cors({
    origin: function (origin, callback) {
        let allowed = true

        if (!origin) allowed = true
        // because mobile app doesn't have an origin

        if (!allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) allowed = false
        // if the origin is not included in our list

        callback(null, allowed)
        // the first parameter is a message we want to return to who made the request
        // the second one is if the response is allowed or not, true or false
    }
